# Messaging System Layer Issues: Troubleshooting Guide

## Problem

The messaging system works correctly in the `/base` layer but fails in the `/car` layer with the following errors:
1. `ReferenceError: useDebounceFn is not defined` at `useMessage.ts:217:27`
2. `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'compose')` at `MessageContainer.vue:344:54`

## Root Cause

These errors are due to missing dependencies and incorrect imports in the `/car` layer that are present in the `/base` layer.

## Solution

### Step 1: Ensure Dependencies are Installed

Make sure that all necessary dependencies are installed in the `/car` layer. Run the following command in the `/car` directory:
```bash
npm install @vueuse/core
```

### Step 2: Correct Imports in `useMessage.ts`

Update the imports in `useMessage.ts` to include `useDebounceFn` from `@vueuse/core`:
```typescript
import { useDebounceFn } from '@vueuse/core';
```

### Step 3: Verify Component Imports

Ensure that all components and composables are correctly imported in `MessageContainer.vue` and other related files. For example, check that `compose` is properly imported and used.

### Step 4: Test the Changes

After making the above changes, test the messaging system in the `/car` layer to ensure that the errors are resolved.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the messaging system issues in the `/car` layer and ensure that it functions correctly as it does in the `/base` layer.
