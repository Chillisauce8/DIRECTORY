# Car Application - Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Car Application is a comprehensive platform designed to address various pain points around owning and searching for classic vehicles (cars, bikes, and potentially boats). This document outlines the functionality, architecture, and key features of the application.

## Key Definitions

### Core Entities

- **User**: An individual person with an account in the system. Users may be vehicle owners, enthusiasts, service providers, or organizational representatives. Each user has a profile, preferences, and can interact with other entities in the system through various permissions and connections.

- **Organization**: An entity that connects users over common purposes and interests. Organizations come in two primary forms:
  - **Clubs**: Community-focused groups centered around specific vehicle interests (e.g., Porsche Club, Local Classic Car Club)
  - **Companies**: Commercial entities providing services (e.g., restoration shops, parts suppliers, dealerships)
  Organizations maintain profiles, can host events, publish content, and interact with users and vehicles.

- **Vehicle**: The physical entity that is the central focus of the application. Primarily cars and motorcycles, but with flexibility to incorporate boats, military vehicles, commercial vehicles, agricultural equipment, etc. Each unique physical vehicle is identified by its VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and can have multiple listings and a comprehensive history file.

- **Market**: A hierarchical categorization system for vehicles that allows for filtering and organization at varying levels of granularity:
  - Starts at high level (Marque/Make - e.g., Ferrari, Porsche)
  - Narrows to Model (e.g., 911, Testarossa)
  - Further refines to Sub-model (e.g., 911 Carrera RS, 911 Turbo)
  - Can include Year ranges or Generations
  - Continues until vehicles cannot be meaningfully segmented further
  Markets allow for tracking, following, and analyzing specific segments of the vehicle community.

### Functional Concepts

- **Listing**: An individual instance of a vehicle being offered for sale. A single physical vehicle may have multiple listings over time as it changes ownership. Listings contain:
  - Sale details (price, location, seller information)
  - Vehicle description and specifications
  - Photos and documentation
  - Listing history and status changes
  Listings are aggregated from various sources and standardized in the platform.

- **Activity**: A time and date-based event that can be added to a calendar. Activities include:
  - **Events**: Car shows, meetups, races, auctions
  - **Maintenance**: Service appointments, repairs, inspections
  - **Milestones**: Restoration completions, purchase anniversaries
  - **Tasks**: Future actions like "renew insurance" or "change oil"
  Activities can be created by users, organizations, or generated by the system.

- **Connection**: A bidirectional relationship between entities in the system (User-Organization, User-Vehicle, Organization-Vehicle) that requires mutual consent and includes configurable permission settings. Connections facilitate information sharing, notifications, and collaborative features.

- **History File**: The comprehensive chronological record of a vehicle's existence, including:
  - Ownership history
  - Maintenance records
  - Restoration work
  - Sale/purchase history
  - Documentation and certifications
  - Modifications and changes
  The history file grows over time and follows the vehicle across owners.

- **Mini-Site**: An organization's digital presence within the application, functioning as a simplified website with customizable sections, galleries, and content. Includes portfolios, event calendars, member listings, and service showcases.

- **Following**: The action of tracking specific entities (vehicles, markets, listings, organizations) to receive notifications and updates about changes, new content, or availability.

### 7. Vehicle History File Ownership & Rights Management

The vehicle history file represents a critical component of vehicle provenance and value. This section outlines how the system handles ownership, transfer, and digital rights management of these valuable historical records.

#### 7.1 History File Ownership Model

- **Primary Ownership**: The current registered vehicle owner holds primary ownership of the vehicle's history file
- **Contributor Rights**: Contributors to a history file (previous owners, service providers, etc.) retain specific rights to their contributed content
- **Digital Rights Tracking**: The system maintains a comprehensive record of:
  - Content origin (who created/added each item)
  - Rights assignments (what permissions exist for each item)
  - Transfer history (how rights have changed over time)

#### 7.2 History File Transfer System

- **Transfer Process**:
  1. Seller initiates history file transfer to buyer during vehicle sale
  2. System creates a permanent snapshot of the history file at point of sale
  3. Buyer receives a complete copy with transferred usage rights
  4. Original owner retains their copy with modified permissions
  5. System records the transfer event in both copies

- **Branching Mechanism**:
  - After transfer, the history file exists in two separate branches:
    1. Seller's branch (historical record, no further vehicle updates)
    2. Buyer's branch (active record, continues to grow)
  - Both branches maintain references to the point of divergence
  - System can compare changes made after the transfer point

- **Historical Snapshots**:
  - Each ownership transfer creates a permanent, immutable snapshot
  - Snapshots serve as verifiable records of the vehicle's condition and history at each sale
  - Previous owners can access their historical contributions but cannot modify post-transfer snapshots
  - Chain of snapshots establishes vehicle provenance

#### 7.3 Digital Rights Management

- **Content Ownership Types**:
  - **Full Ownership**: Creator retains all rights to the content
  - **Assigned Usage Rights**: Specific permissions granted to others
  - **Vehicle-Bound Content**: Rights that transfer with vehicle ownership

- **Media Rights Categories**:
  - **Personal Documentation**: Owner's personal photos and records
  - **Service Documentation**: Content created by service providers
  - **Historical Documentation**: Content with historical significance
  - **Third-Party Content**: Content from external sources with specific usage rights

- **Rights Assignment Framework**:
  - All content has explicitly defined digital rights:
    - Creator attribution (always maintained)
    - Display permission (who can view)
    - Distribution permission (who can share)
    - Modification permission (who can edit)
    - Commercial usage permission (who can use commercially)

- **Default Rights Templates**:
  - Owner-created content: Full rights, transfers with vehicle
  - Service provider content: Shared rights between provider and owner
  - Historical documentation: View-only rights with attribution requirement
  - External content: Based on source-specific licenses

#### 7.4 Service Provider Content Management

- **Work Documentation Rights**:
  - Service providers who document their work obtain non-exclusive rights
  - Vehicle owners receive usage rights to service documentation
  - Both parties must agree to rights before content is added to history file

- **Portfolio Usage Rights**:
  - Organizations can request portfolio usage rights for their work
  - Owners can grant portfolio rights while maintaining vehicle history rights
  - Portfolio rights are specifically limited to promotional purposes
  - Clear attribution and privacy controls are maintained

- **Rights Assignment Process**:
  1. Content creator (e.g., restoration company) adds documentation to vehicle
  2. System prompts for rights assignment selection
  3. Vehicle owner receives notification and approves/modifies rights
  4. System records the agreed rights framework
  5. Both parties receive proper permissions according to agreement

#### 7.5 Rights Transfer Workflow

- **Pre-Sale Preparation**:
  - System analyzes history file content rights before transfer
  - Identifies transferable vs. non-transferable content
  - Generates rights transfer preview for seller review

- **Rights Transfer Authorization**:
  - Seller explicitly authorizes rights transfer during sale process
  - System validates all transferable rights
  - Non-transferable content is flagged or removed from transfer
