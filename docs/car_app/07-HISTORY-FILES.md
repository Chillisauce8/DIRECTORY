# Vehicle History and Rights Management

The vehicle history file represents a critical component of vehicle provenance and value. This document outlines how the system handles ownership, transfer, and digital rights management of these valuable historical records.

## History File Ownership Model

- **Primary Ownership**: The current registered vehicle owner holds primary ownership of the vehicle's history file
- **Contributor Rights**: Contributors to a history file (previous owners, service providers, etc.) retain specific rights to their contributed content
- **Digital Rights Tracking**: The system maintains a comprehensive record of:
  - Content origin (who created/added each item)
  - Rights assignments (what permissions exist for each item)
  - Transfer history (how rights have changed over time)

## History File Transfer System

### Transfer Process

1. Seller initiates history file transfer to buyer during vehicle sale
2. System creates a permanent snapshot of the history file at point of sale
3. Buyer receives a complete copy with transferred usage rights
4. Original owner retains their copy with modified permissions
5. System records the transfer event in both copies

### Branching Mechanism

- After transfer, the history file exists in two separate branches:
  1. Seller's branch (historical record, no further vehicle updates)
  2. Buyer's branch (active record, continues to grow)
- Both branches maintain references to the point of divergence
- System can compare changes made after the transfer point

### Historical Snapshots

- Each ownership transfer creates a permanent, immutable snapshot
- Snapshots serve as verifiable records of the vehicle's condition and history at each sale
- Previous owners can access their historical contributions but cannot modify post-transfer snapshots
- Chain of snapshots establishes vehicle provenance

## Digital Rights Management

### Content Ownership Types

- **Full Ownership**: Creator retains all rights to the content
- **Assigned Usage Rights**: Specific permissions granted to others
- **Vehicle-Bound Content**: Rights that transfer with vehicle ownership

### Media Rights Categories

- **Personal Documentation**: Owner's personal photos and records
- **Service Documentation**: Content created by service providers
- **Historical Documentation**: Content with historical significance
- **Third-Party Content**: Content from external sources with specific usage rights

### Rights Assignment Framework

- All content has explicitly defined digital rights:
  - Creator attribution (always maintained)
  - Display permission (who can view)
  - Distribution permission (who can share)
  - Modification permission (who can edit)
  - Commercial usage permission (who can use commercially)

### Default Rights Templates

- Owner-created content: Full rights, transfers with vehicle
- Service provider content: Shared rights between provider and owner
- Historical documentation: View-only rights with attribution requirement
- External content: Based on source-specific licenses

## Service Provider Content Management

### Work Documentation Rights

- Service providers who document their work obtain non-exclusive rights
- Vehicle owners receive usage rights to service documentation
- Both parties must agree to rights before content is added to history file

### Portfolio Usage Rights

- Organizations can request portfolio usage rights for their work
- Owners can grant portfolio rights while maintaining vehicle history rights
- Portfolio rights are specifically limited to promotional purposes
- Clear attribution and privacy controls are maintained

### Rights Assignment Process

1. Content creator (e.g., restoration company) adds documentation to vehicle
2. System prompts for rights assignment selection
3. Vehicle owner receives notification and approves/modifies rights
4. System records the agreed rights framework
5. Both parties receive proper permissions according to agreement

## Rights Transfer Workflow

### Pre-Sale Preparation

- System analyzes history file content rights before transfer
- Identifies transferable vs. non-transferable content
- Generates rights transfer preview for seller review

### Rights Transfer Authorization

- Seller explicitly authorizes rights transfer during sale process
- System validates all transferable rights
- Non-transferable content is flagged or removed from transfer

### Post-Transfer Confirmation

- Buyer confirms receipt of transferred history file
- System provides buyer with clear overview of received rights
- Both parties receive transfer confirmation with rights summary

### Rights Dispute Resolution

- Built-in mechanism for reporting rights violations
- Process for negotiating rights modifications
- System-maintained audit trail for all rights changes

## Technical Implementation

### Rights Metadata Storage

- Each content item stores comprehensive rights metadata
- Rights changes are versioned and timestamped
- Blockchain-inspired verification ensures rights integrity

### Branching Implementation

- Git-inspired branching model for history files
- Efficient storage of shared history with delta-based changes
- Conflict resolution system for disputed changes

### Transfer Mechanism

- Atomic operations ensure complete transfer integrity
- Transaction log maintains record of all transfers
- Rollback capability for failed transfers

### Privacy Controls

- Granular privacy settings for sensitive content
- Geographic restrictions compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Time-based access controls for temporary permissions
