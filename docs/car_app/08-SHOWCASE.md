# Vehicle Showcase System

The Vehicle Showcase system enables owners to create and share curated presentations of their vehicles with varying levels of detail and access permissions, facilitating social interactions both online and at physical events.

## Vehicle Showcase Concept

### Curated Presentations
- Owner-created vehicle showcases with selected information
- Distinct from comprehensive history files which may contain private information
- Focused on presentation and storytelling versus complete documentation
- Multiple showcases can be created for the same vehicle for different contexts

### Database Structure
- Leverages the existing 1:many Vehicle-to-Listings relationship
- Showcases stored as a specialized type of "listing" (non-sales)
- Contains references to selected content from the vehicle's history file
- Maintains specialized metadata for sharing and permissions

### AI-Assisted Creation
- Intelligent showcase templates based on context (car meet, club display, general public)
- AI suggestion system for selecting appealing content from vehicle history
- Automated caption and description generation
- Content organization recommendations based on viewer engagement patterns
