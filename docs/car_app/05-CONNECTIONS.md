# Connection Management System

The Connection Management System facilitates relationships between different entities in the application through a bidirectional invitation and acceptance process. This document outlines the principles, types, and implementation of these connections.

## Core Connection Principles

- **Bidirectional Consent**: All connections require explicit permission from both parties
- **Granular Permissions**: Each connection includes configurable permission settings
- **Independent Control**: Either party can modify or terminate the connection at any time
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into all active connections and their permission states

## Connection Types

### Group Membership Connections

Connections between individual users and organizations:

#### Creation Process
1. Organization creates a member group and sends invitations
2. Users receive notification of group invitation
3. Users accept invitation with customizable permission settings
4. Connection is established with agreed-upon terms

#### Permission Granularity
- Message reception (can the group send you messages?)
- Profile visibility (is your profile visible to other group members?)
- Public listing (are you listed as a member publicly?)
- Event notifications (do you receive event invitations?)
- Content sharing (can your content be featured in group galleries?)

#### Management Controls
- Organizations can add/remove members and modify group settings
- Users can adjust their individual permission settings at any time
- Both parties can terminate the connection completely

### Vehicle Service Connections

Connections between vehicle owners and service providers:

#### Authorization Flow
1. Vehicle owner initiates service connection with a company
2. Company receives notification and accepts the service relationship
3. Company gains ability to add activities/work records to the vehicle
4. Owner receives notifications of work updates for review/acceptance

#### Permission Settings
- Activity creation (what types of activities can be added?)
- Content publishing (can work be featured in company portfolio?)
- Photo/document access (what vehicle documents can be viewed?)
- Timeline integration (do activities appear on vehicle timeline?)
- Notification frequency (how often to receive updates?)

#### Activity Acceptance Process
1. Company adds work record to vehicle service history
2. Owner receives notification of new activity
3. Owner reviews and accepts/comments on the activity
4. Accepted activities become part of the official vehicle history

### Staff Management Connections

Connections between organizations and their staff members:

#### Staff Onboarding
1. Organization owner adds staff member to organization
2. Staff receives invitation with role and permission details
3. Staff accepts position with customizable notification preferences
4. Staff gains organization-specific permissions

#### Permission Levels
- Activity management (can create/edit work activities)
- Customer interaction (can message customers)
- Content creation (can add photos/documentation)
- Administrative access (can modify organization settings)
- Billing capabilities (can create/send invoices)

#### Connection Management
- Organization can modify staff roles and permissions
- Staff can adjust notification and privacy settings
- Either party can terminate the employment relationship

## Technical Implementation

### Connection Storage
- Dedicated connections collection with relationship metadata
- Bidirectional references to both connected entities
- Timestamped history of connection changes
- Permission settings storage as configurable flags

### Notification System Integration
- Real-time alerts for connection requests
- Status updates when connections change
- Digest notifications for connection activity
- Action items for pending connection decisions

### Privacy Controls
- Data access limited to connection participants
- Audit logging for connection changes
- Privacy-first default settings
- Clear visibility of what each permission entails

## User Interface Elements

### Connection Dashboard
- Central hub for managing all connections
- Pending invitation management
- Active connection configuration
- Connection history and activity log

### Permission Configuration
- Visual toggle interface for permission settings
- Batch operations for multiple connections
- Permission templates for common scenarios
- Clear explanation of each permission's implications

### Connection Requests
- Modal dialogs for incoming connection requests
- Detailed explanation of request context
- Preview of requested permissions
- Option to accept, decline, or customize before accepting

## Connection Workflow Examples

### Club Membership Scenario
1. Car club creates a new member group for "Ferrari Owners"
2. Club administrator sends invitations to Ferrari owners in the system
3. User receives notification of invitation to join the Ferrari Owners group
4. User reviews permission requests (messaging, event notifications, etc.)
5. User accepts with custom settings (allows messages, declines public listing)
6. Connection is established with selected permissions
7. User appears in club's private directory but not public listing
8. User begins receiving club messages and event invitations

### Vehicle Service Scenario
1. Vehicle owner schedules service with a restoration shop
2. Owner sends service connection request to the shop
3. Shop accepts the connection with requested permissions
4. Shop performs restoration work on the vehicle
5. Shop adds detailed documentation of the restoration process
6. Owner receives notifications of documentation additions
7. Owner reviews and approves the documentation
8. Approved documentation appears in vehicle's official history
9. Shop can (with permission) showcase the work in their portfolio

### Staff Role Scenario
1. Organization owner creates staff account for new mechanic
2. Owner assigns initial role and permissions
3. Mechanic receives invitation with role details
4. Mechanic accepts position and customizes notification settings
5. Mechanic gains access to organization's customer vehicles
6. Mechanic can add service documentation to customer vehicles
7. Owner can monitor mechanic's activity and performance
8. Both parties can adjust or terminate the connection if needed

## Integration with Other Systems

### Vehicle History Integration
- Service connections create verified entries in vehicle histories
- Professional service records enhance vehicle provenance
- Service providers build portfolios through these connections
- Ownership transfers include connection management options

### Organization Features Integration
- Member connections determine organization content visibility
- Staff connections enable content creation and management
- Service connections facilitate customer relationship management
- Connection analytics provide organization performance insights

### User Privacy Integration
- Connections respect global user privacy settings
- Permission adjustments appear in user privacy dashboard
- Data sharing is explicitly outlined for each connection
- Privacy impact is clearly explained before connection acceptance
