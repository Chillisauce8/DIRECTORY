# Core Concepts and Definitions

This document defines the fundamental entities and concepts that form the foundation of the Car Application system.

## Core Entities

### User

An individual person with an account in the system. Users may be vehicle owners, enthusiasts, service providers, or organizational representatives. Each user has:

- Profile information and preferences
- Connection relationships with other entities
- Activity history and engagement metrics
- Permission settings and privacy controls
- Following relationships (markets, vehicles, organizations)

Users interact with vehicles, organizations, and other users through various interfaces and connection types.

### Organization

An entity that connects users over common purposes and interests. Organizations come in two primary forms:

#### Clubs
Community-focused groups centered around specific vehicle interests:
- Porsche Club
- Local Classic Car Club
- Vintage Racing Association
- Historical Preservation Society

#### Companies
Commercial entities providing services:
- Restoration shops
- Parts suppliers
- Dealerships
- Insurance providers
- Storage facilities
- Transportation services

Organizations maintain profiles, host events, publish content, and interact with users and vehicles through connection relationships.

### Vehicle

The physical entity that is the central focus of the application. Primarily cars and motorcycles, but with flexibility to incorporate:
- Classic cars
- Vintage motorcycles
- Historic boats
- Military vehicles
- Commercial vehicles
- Agricultural equipment

Each unique physical vehicle is identified by its VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) and can have:
- Multiple listings (sales entries) over time
- A comprehensive history file
- Ownership records
- Technical specifications
- Documentation and media

### Market

A hierarchical categorization system for vehicles that allows for filtering and organization at varying levels of granularity:

- **Level 1**: Marque/Make (e.g., Ferrari, Porsche)
- **Level 2**: Model (e.g., 911, Testarossa)
- **Level 3**: Sub-model (e.g., 911 Carrera RS, 911 Turbo)
- **Level 4**: Generation/Year range (e.g., 964-series, 993-series)
- **Level 5+**: Further refinements until vehicles cannot be meaningfully segmented further

Markets serve as the primary organizational structure for content and following relationships, allowing users to track, follow, and analyze specific segments of the vehicle community.

## Functional Concepts

### Listing

An individual instance of a vehicle being offered for sale. A single physical vehicle may have multiple listings over time as it changes ownership. Listings contain:

- Sale details (price, location, seller information)
- Vehicle description and specifications
- Photos and documentation
- Listing history and status changes

Listings are aggregated from various sources (auctions, classifieds, dealer inventories) and standardized in the platform.

### Activity

A time and date-based event that can be added to a calendar. Activities include:

- **Events**: Car shows, meetups, races, auctions
- **Maintenance**: Service appointments, repairs, inspections
- **Milestones**: Restoration completions, purchase anniversaries
- **Tasks**: Future actions like "renew insurance" or "change oil"

Activities can be created by users, organizations, or generated by the system, and serve as the backbone of the calendar system.

### Connection

A bidirectional relationship between entities in the system (User-Organization, User-Vehicle, Organization-Vehicle) that requires mutual consent and includes configurable permission settings. Connections:

- Must be approved by both parties
- Include specific permission settings
- Can be modified or terminated by either party
- Facilitate information sharing and notifications

Connections provide the foundation for the privacy and permission model in the system.

### History File

The comprehensive chronological record of a vehicle's existence, including:

- Ownership history
- Maintenance records
- Restoration work
- Sale/purchase history
- Documentation and certifications
- Modifications and changes

The history file grows over time and follows the vehicle across owners, with each ownership transfer creating a permanent snapshot of the vehicle's condition and history at that point.

### Mini-Site

An organization's digital presence within the application, functioning as a simplified website with customizable sections, galleries, and content. Includes:

- Organization profile and information
- Event calendars and registration
- Member listings (with appropriate permissions)
- Service showcases
- Media galleries
- Project portfolios

Mini-sites provide organizations with a comprehensive digital presence without requiring an external website.

### Following

The action of tracking specific entities (vehicles, markets, listings, organizations) to receive notifications and updates about changes, new content, or availability. Following relationships:

- Are initiated by the user
- Do not require approval from the followed entity
- Generate notifications based on user preferences
- Can be organized by categories or priority
- Inform feed and content personalization
