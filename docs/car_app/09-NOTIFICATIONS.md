# Feed Personalization and Notification System

The Feed Personalization and Notification System integrates data from across the platform to create tailored content streams for users based on their interests, follows, and preferences.

## Integrated Market Following

### Hierarchical Following Model
- Users can follow markets at any level of the hierarchy (Make, Model, Submodel)
- Following a parent market automatically includes content from child markets
- Example: Following "Porsche" includes "911", "Carrera", "Turbo", etc.
- Follows are stored in a dedicated collection with user references

### Market Connection Framework
- Markets form the backbone of content organization
- Organizations, listings, pages, and activities all link to specific markets
- Multi-market connections allow for cross-market content
- Market metadata includes relevance scores for recommendation algorithms

### Follow Management
- Centralized follow dashboard in user settings
- Visual representation of market hierarchy with follow status
- Bulk follow/unfollow capabilities for market categories
- Follow strength indicators (engagement metrics)

## Personalized Content Feed
