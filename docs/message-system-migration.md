# Message System Migration Sequence

## Core Principles and Revised Strategy

1. **System Status:**
   - The messaging application is not live yet.
   - It is not fully functional; we are rebuilding from the ground up to get the basics right.

2. **Rollback Approach:**
   - **Do not create component copies for rollback.**  
     Instead of duplicating components, use version control (git branches) to maintain a clean history and allow safe rollback if needed.

3. **Nuxt 3 and Naming Conflicts:**
   - Avoid duplicate file names.  
     Components must be renamed with unique, descriptive names to prevent Nuxt auto-import conflicts.
   - _Example:_  
     `MessageContainer.vue` → `MessageInboxLayout.vue`  
     `MessageComposer.vue` → `MessageComposeDialog.vue`  
     `MessageListItem.vue` → `MessageInboxListItem.vue`  
     `MessageSidebar.vue` → `MessageFolderNav.vue`

4. **Full Code Implementations:**
   - Do not use placeholder comments like `<!-- rest of existing code... -->`.  
     Always include the complete, production-ready code for each component split.

## Git Strategy
- Use dedicated branches for each phase of the migration:
  ```bash
  main                 # Stable baseline
  ├── feature/types    # Type system updates
  ├── feature/store    # Store & service updates
  ├── feature/components  # New component implementations with unique names
  └── feature/integration  # Integration and routing changes
  ```

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests:** Verify core functionality (type safety, API integration, store operations).
- **Integration tests:** Test basic messaging flows and component interactions.
- **Visual regression tests:** Ensure styling, responsiveness, and animations remain consistent.
- **Performance benchmarks:** Measure load times, state updates, and bundle size improvements.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)
1. **Type System (Day 1)**
   - Update base types across `_Node.ts`, `messages.ts`, and `userMessageStates.ts`.
   - **Objective:** Ensure compile-time safety.

2. **Store & Service (Days 2-3)**
   - Implement messaging service and update the Pinia store.
   - **Objective:** Establish robust state management and API integration.

### Phase 2: Component Migration (Days 4-8)

### Component Strategy Update
Since the messaging system is in development (not live):
1. We will **not** create duplicate components
2. Instead, we will:
   - Use git branches for version control
   - Refactor existing components directly
   - Keep clear commit history for rollback capability
   - Use meaningful commit messages for each change

### MessageListItem Changes (Day 4)
1. Rename existing component to follow naming convention
2. Update imports and references
3. Enhance functionality with new features
4. Test changes thoroughly
5. Commit with clear message

1. **MessageInboxListItem Component (Day 4)**
   - Extract and implement message list functionality in a new component with a unique name.
   - **Objective:** Create an independent, visually consistent component.

2. **MessageComposeDialog Component (Days 5-6)**
   - Split the old MessageComposer into dedicated components for new messages and replies.
   - **Objective:** Isolate complex functionality in a testable dialog.
   - **Note:** Ensure full code implementation (no placeholder comments).

3. **MessageDetail Enhancement (Days 7-8)**
   - Develop a new MessageThreadView component that includes thread support.
   - **Objective:** Support detailed message view and interactive threads.

### Phase 3: Integration (Days 9-12)
1. ✓ **Route Updates (Day 9)**
   - ✓ Revise the routing structure
   - ✓ Update deep linking
   - ✓ Test navigation consistency

2. ✓ **Store Integration (Days 10-11)**
   - ✓ Connect all new components to the updated store
   - **Key tasks:**
     1. ✓ Verify state synchronization
     2. ✓ Test optimistic updates
     3. ✓ Add error handling
     4. ✓ Monitor performance
     5. ✓ Document state flow

3. **Error Handling (Day 12)**
   - ✓ Implement comprehensive error management
   - ✓ Add error logging
   - ✓ Create error boundaries
   - ✓ Test error scenarios
   - ✓ Update documentation

### Phase 4: Refinement (Days 13-15)
1. **Performance Optimization (Day 13)**
   - [ ] Add loading states and skeletons
   - [ ] Optimize rendering
   - [ ] Add state caching
   - [ ] Reduce bundle size
   - [ ] Verify performance metrics

2. **Migration Verification (Day 14)**
   - Run full regression, visual, and user acceptance tests.
   - **Objective:** Validate every change before deployment.

3. **Deployment (Day 15)**
   - Activate feature flags and begin gradual rollout.
   - **Objective:** Monitor for any regressions and prepare rollback (via git) if necessary.

## Success Criteria for Each Phase
1. **Foundation**
   - All types compile without errors.
   - Store and service functions work as expected.
2. **Components**
   - Visual consistency with the original design.
   - All interactions (event handling, responsiveness) are functioning.
3. **Integration**
   - State synchronization and routing work seamlessly.
   - Error management is robust.
4. **Refinement**
   - Performance meets or exceeds targets.
   - Regression tests pass and documentation is complete.

---

## Risk Assessment & Rollback Plan
Given the system is not live and not fully functional:
- We favor **using git branches** for version rollback rather than duplicating components.
- Rollback is managed by reverting to a previous git commit.
- Feature flags will control the gradual activation of new components during integration.

## Current Step: MessageComposeDialog Migration

### Step 1: Create New Component (Day 5)
1. Create new file: `/components/message/compose/MessageComposeDialog.vue`
2. Copy full implementation (no placeholders)
3. Keep existing MessageComposer.vue functional
4. Add comprehensive tests

### Step 2: Test in Isolation (Day 5)
1. Create test page for new component
2. Verify all functionality:
   - New message composition
   - Reply mode
   - Form validation
   - File attachments
   - Error handling

### Step 3: Integration (Day 6)
1. Update MessageContainer.vue to support both components
2. Test both components working together
3. Verify no regression in existing functionality
4. Only remove old component after full validation

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All dialog states work
- [ ] Form validation intact
- [ ] Reply functionality working
- [ ] CSS/styling matches exactly
- [ ] All events emit correctly

This revised strategy eliminates component duplication for rollback, prevents Nuxt naming conflicts, ensures complete code implementations, and leverages robust git version control. It focuses on establishing core functionality before adding advanced features.
